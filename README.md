React Routing is a crucial aspect of building modern web applications using the React JavaScript library. It provides a powerful and flexible way to manage the navigation and user interface (UI) of a single-page application (SPA). React Routing allows developers to create dynamic, client-side navigation experiences, enabling users to move between different views or pages within an application without the need for full page reloads.
